## Installation

The project is organized into two main folders: `client` and `server`. The `client` folder contains all the frontend logic, while the `server` folder contains all the backend logic.

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bejabeja/tobetraveller.git
   cd tobeatraveller
   ```


2. First, install all necessary dependencies for both the client and server:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. Now you can use the Makefile to easily start or stop both the client and server:

- To start both the client and server, run:
   ```bash
   make start
   ```

- To stop both processes and free the ports, run:
   ```bash
   make stop
   ```

4. Access the application:

Once both processes are running, you can access the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
